#Ooyala Signature Generator

This node module returns the signature that is required for an [Ooyala](http://www.ooyala.com/) API request. This is a simple utility that follows the spec for the [general signing algorythm](http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/tasks/api_signing_requests.html). There are examples for many other server-side languages in [their docs](http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/tasks/api_signing_requests_appendix.html).
